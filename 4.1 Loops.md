# Loops

## For Loops: Introduction
Now that we can appreciate what loops do for us, let’s start with your first type of loop, a for loop, a type of definite iteration.

In a for loop, we will know in advance how many times the loop will need to iterate because we will be working on a collection with a predefined length. In our examples, we will be using Python lists as our collection of elements.

With for loops, on each iteration, we will be able to perform an action on each element of the collection.

Before we work with any collection, let’s examine the general structure of a for loop:
```
for <temporary variable> in <collection>:
  <action>
```

Let’s break down each of these components:
1. A for keyword indicates the start of a for loop.
2. A \<temporary variable> that is used to represent the value of the element in the collection the loop is currently on.
3. An in keyword separates the temporary variable from the collection used for iteration.
4. A \<collection> to loop over. In our examples, we will be using a list.
5. An \<action> to do anything on each iteration of the loop.

Let’s link these concepts back to our ingredients example. This for loop prints each ingredient in ingredients:
```PY
ingredients = ["milk", "sugar", "vanilla extract", "dough", "chocolate"]
 
for ingredient in ingredients:
  print(ingredient)
```

In this example:
1. ingredient is the \<temporary variable>.
2. ingredients is our \<collection>.
3. print(ingredient) was the \<action> performed on every iteration using the temporary variable of ingredient.

This code outputs:
```
milk
sugar
vanilla extract
dough
chocolate
```

Some things to note about for loops:
* Temporary Variables:
    A temporary variable’s name is arbitrary and does not need to be defined beforehand. Both of the following code snippets do the exact same thing as our above example:
    ```PY
    for i in ingredients:
      print(i)
    ```

    ```PY
    for item in ingredients:
      print(item)
    ```

    Programming best practices suggest we make our temporary variables as descriptive as possible. Since each iteration (step) of our loop is accessing an ingredient it makes more sense to call our temporary variable ingredient rather than i or item.

* Indentation:
    Notice that in all of these examples the print statement is indented. Everything at the same level of indentation after the for loop declaration is included in the loop body and is run on every iteration of the loop.
    ```PY
    for ingredient in ingredients:
      # Any code at this level of indentation 
      # will run on each iteration of the loop
      print(ingredient)
    ```

    If we ever forget to indent, we’ll get an IndentationError or unexpected behavior.

* Elegant loops:
    Python loves to help us write elegant code so it allows us to write simple for loops in one-line. In order to see the below example as one line, you may need to expand your narrative window. Here is the previous example in a single line:
    ```PY
    for ingredient in ingredients: print(ingredient)
    ```

    Note: One-line for loops are useful for simple programs. It is not recommended you write one-line loops for any loop that has to perform multiple complex actions on each iteration. Doing so will hurt the readability of your code and may ultimately lead to buggier code.

## For Loops: Using Range
Often we won’t be iterating through a specific list (or any collection), but rather only want to perform a certain action multiple times.

For example, if we wanted to print out a "Learning Loops!" message six times using a for loop, we would follow this structure:
```
for <temporary variable> in <list of length 6>:
  print("Learning Loops!")
```

Notice that we need to iterate through a list with a length of six, but we don’t necessarily care what is inside of the list.

To create arbitrary collections of any length, we can pair our for loops with the trusty Python built-in function range().

An example of how the range() function works, this code generates a collection of 6 integer elements from 0 to 5:
```PY
six_steps = range(6)
 
# six_steps is now a collection with 6 elements:
# 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

We can then use the range directly in our for loops as the collection to perform a six-step iteration:
```PY
for temp in range(6):
  print("Learning Loops!")
```

Would output:
```
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
```

Something to note is we are not using temp anywhere inside of the loop body. If we are curious about which loop iteration (step) we are on, we can use temp to track it. Since our range starts at 0, we will add + 1 to our temp to represent how many iterations (steps) our loop takes more accurately.
```PY
for temp in range(6):
  print("Loop is on iteration number " + str(temp + 1))
```

Would output:
```
Loop is on iteration number 1
Loop is on iteration number 2
Loop is on iteration number 3
Loop is on iteration number 4
Loop is on iteration number 5
Loop is on iteration number 6
```

## While Loops: Introduction
In Python, for loops are not the only type of loops we can use. Another type of loop is called a while loop and is a form of indefinite iteration.

A while loop performs a set of instructions as long as a given condition is true.

The structure follows this pattern:
```PY
while <conditional statement>:
  <action>
```

Let’s examine this example, where we print the integers 0 through 3:
```PY
count = 0
while count <= 3:
  # Loop Body
  print(count)
  count += 1
```

Let’s break the loop down:
1. count is initially defined with the value of 0. The conditional statement in the while loop is count <= 3, which is true at the initial iteration of the loop, so the loop body executes.
2. Inside the loop body, count is printed and then incremented by 1.
3. When the first iteration of the loop has finished, Python returns to the top of the loop and checks the conditional again. After the first iteration, count would be equal to 1 so the conditional still evaluates to True and so the loop continues.
4. This continues until the count variable becomes 4. At that point, when the conditional is tested it will no longer be True and the loop will stop.

The output would be:
```
0
1
2
3
```

Note the following about while loops before we write our own:
* Indentation:
    Notice that in our example the code under the loop declaration is indented. Similar to a for loop, everything at the same level of indentation after the while loop declaration is run on every iteration of the loop while the condition is true.
    ```PY
    while count <= 3:
      # Loop Body
      print(count)
      count += 1
      # Any other code at this level of indentation will
      # run on each iteration
    ```

    If we ever forget to indent, we’ll get an IndentationError or unexpected behavior.

* Elegant loops:
    Similar to for loops, Python allows us to write elegant one-line while loops. Here is our previous example in a single line:
    ```PY
    count = 0
    while count <= 3: print(count); count += 1
    ```

    Note: Here we separate each statement with a ; to denote a separate line of code.

## Loop Control: Break
Loops in Python are very versatile. Python provides a set of control statements that we can use to get even more control out of our loops.

Let’s take a look at a common scenario that we may encounter to see a use case for loop control statements.

Take the following list items_on_sale as our example:
```PY
items_on_sale = ["blue shirt", "striped socks", "knit dress", "red headband", "dinosaur onesie"]
```

It’s often the case that we want to search a list to check if a specific value exists. What does our loop look like if we want to search for the value of "knit dress" and print out "Found it" if it did exist?

It would look something like this:
```PY
for item in items_on_sale:
  if item == "knit dress":
    print("Found it")
```

This code goes through each item in items_on_sale and checks for a match. This is all fine and dandy but what’s the downside?

Once "knit_dress" is found in the list items_on_sale, we don’t need to go through the rest of the items_on_sale list. Unfortunately, our loop will keep running until we reach the end of the list.

Since it’s only 5 elements long, iterating through the entire list is not a big deal in this case but what if items_on_sale had 1000 items? What if it had 100,000 items? This would be a huge waste of time for our program!

Thankfully you can stop iteration from inside the loop by using break loop control statement.

When the program hits a break statement it immediately terminates a loop. For example:
```PY
items_on_sale = ["blue shirt", "striped socks", "knit dress", "red headband", "dinosaur onesie"]
 
print("Checking the sale list!")
 
for item in items_on_sale:
  print(item)
  if item == "knit dress":
    break
 
print("End of search!")
```

This would produce the output:
```
Checking the sale list!
blue shirt
striped socks
knit dress
End of search!
```

When the loop entered the if statement and saw the break it immediately ended the loop. We didn’t need to check the elements of "red headband" or "dinosaur onesie" at all.

## Loop Control: Continue
While the break control statement will come in handy, there are other situations where we don’t want to end the loop entirely. What if we only want to skip the current iteration of the loop?

Let’s take this list of integers as our example:
```PY
big_number_list = [1, 2, -1, 4, -5, 5, 2, -9]
```

What if we want to print out all of the numbers in a list, but only if they are positive integers. We can use another common loop control statement called continue.
```PY
for i in big_number_list:
  if i <= 0:
    continue
  print(i)
```

This would produce the output:
```
1
2
4
5
2
```

Notice a few things:
1. Similar to when we were using the break control statement, our continue control statement is usually paired with some form of a conditional (if/elif/else).
2. When our loop first encountered an element (-1) that met the conditions of the if statement, it checked the code inside the block and saw the continue. When the loop then encounters a continue statement it immediately skips the current iteration and moves onto the next element in the list (4).
3. The output of the list only printed positive integers in the list because every time our loop entered the if statement and saw the continue statement it simply moved to the next iteration of the list and thus never reached the print statement.

## List Comprehensions: Introduction
So far we have seen many of the ideas about using loops in our code. Python prides itself on allowing programmers to write clean and elegant code. We have already seen this with Python giving us the ability to write while and for loops in a single line.

In this exercise, we are going to examine another way we can write elegant loops in our programs using list comprehensions.

To start, let’s say we had a list of integers and wanted to create a list where each element is doubled. We could accomplish this using a for loop and a new list called doubled:
```PY
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
doubled = []
 
for number in numbers:
  doubled.append(number * 2)
 
print(doubled)
```

Would output:
```
[4, -2, 158, 66, -90]
```

Let’s see how we can use the power of list comprehensions to solve these types of problems in one line. Here is our same problem but now written as a list comprehension:
```PY
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
doubled = [num * 2 for num in numbers]
print(doubled)
```

Let’s break down our example in a more general way:
```
new_list = [<expression> for <element> in <collection>]
```

In our doubled example, our list comprehension:
1. Takes an element in the list numbers
2. Assigns that element to a variable called num (our \<element>)
3. Applies the \<expression> on the element stored in num and adds the result to a new list called doubled
4. Repeats steps 1-3 for every other element in the numbers list (our \<collection>)

Our result would be the same:
```
[4, -2, 158, 66, -90]
```

## List Comprehensions: Conditionals
List Comprehensions are very flexible. We even can expand our examples to incorporate conditional logic.

Suppose we wanted to double only our negative numbers from our previous numbers list.

We will start by using a for loop and a list only_negative_doubled:
```PY
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
only_negative_doubled = []
 
for num in numbers:
  if num < 0: 
    only_negative_doubled.append(num * 2)
 
print(only_negative_doubled) 
```

Would output:
```
[-2, -90]
```

Now, here is what our code would look like using a list comprehension:
```PY
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
negative_doubled = [num * 2 for num in numbers if num < 0]
print(negative_doubled)
```

Would output the same result:
```
[-2, -90]
```
In our negative_doubled example, our list comprehension:
1. Takes an element in the list numbers.
2. Assigns that element to a variable called num.
3. Checks if the condition num < 0 is met by the element stored in num. If so, it goes to step 4, otherwise it skips it and goes to the next element in the list.
4. Applies the expression num * 2 on the element stored in num and adds the result to a new list called negative_doubled
5. Repeats steps 1-3 (and sometimes 4) for every other element in the numbers list.

We can also use If-Else conditions directly in our comprehensions. For example, let’s say we wanted to double every negative number but triple all positive numbers. Here is what our code might look like:
```PY
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
doubled = [num * 2 if num < 0 else num * 3 for num in numbers ]
print(doubled)
```

Would output:
```
[6, -2, 237, 99, -90]
```

This is a bit different than our previous comprehension since the conditional if num < 0 else num * 3 comes after the expression num * 2 but before our for keyword.
