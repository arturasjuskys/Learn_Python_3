# Dictionaries

## Try/Except to Get a Key
We saw that we can avoid KeyErrors by checking if a key is in a dictionary first. Another method we could use is a try/except:
```PY
key_to_check = "Landmark 81"
try:
  print(building_heights[key_to_check])
except KeyError:
  print("That key doesn't exist!")
```

When we try to access a key that doesnâ€™t exist, the program will go into the except block and print "That key doesn't exist!".
