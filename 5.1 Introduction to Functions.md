# Functions

## Defining a Function
A function consists of many parts, so let’s first get familiar with its core - a function definition.

Here’s an example of a function definition:
```PY
def function_name():
  # functions tasks go here
```

There are some key components we want to note here:
* The def keyword indicates the beginning of a function (also known as a function header). The function header is followed by a name in snake_case format that describes the task the function performs. It’s best practice to give your functions a descriptive yet concise name.
* Following the function name is a pair of parenthesis ( ) that can hold input values known as parameters (more on parameters later in the lesson!). In this example function, we have no parameters.
* A colon : to mark the end of the function header.
* Lastly, we have one or more valid python statements that make up the function body (where we have our python comment).

Notice we’ve indented our # function tasks go here comment. Like loops and conditionals, code inside a function must be indented to show that they are part of the function.

Here is an example of a function that greets a user for our trip planning application:
```PY
def trip_welcome():
  print("Welcome to Tripcademy!") 
  print("Let's get you to your destination.")
```

Note: Pasting this code into the editor and clicking Run will result in an empty output terminal. The print() statements within the function will not execute since our function hasn’t been used. We will explore this further in the next exercise; for now, let’s practice defining a function.

## Calling a Function
Now that we’ve practiced defining a function, let’s learn about calling a function to execute the code within its body.

The process of executing the code inside the body of a function is known as calling it (This is also known as “executing a function”). To call a function in Python, type out its name followed by parentheses ( ).

Let’s revisit our directions_to_timesSq() function :
```PY
def directions_to_timesSq():
  print("Walk 4 mins to 34th St Herald Square train station.")
  print("Take the Northbound N, Q, R, or W train 1 stop.")
  print("Get off the Times Square 42nd Street stop.")
```

To call our function, we must type out the function’s name followed by a pair of parentheses and no indentation:
```PY
directions_to_timesSq()
```

Calling the function will execute the print statements within the body (from the top statement to the bottom statement) and result in the following output:
```
Walk 4 mins to 34th St Herald Square train station.
Take the Northbound N, Q, R, or W train 1 stop.
Get off the Times Square 42nd Street stop.
```

Note that you can only call a function after it has been defined in your code.

## Returns
At this point, our functions have been using print() to help us visualize the output in our interpreter. Functions can also return a value to the program so that this value can be modified or used later. We use the Python keyword return to do this.

Here’s an example of a program that will return a converted currency for a given location a user may want to visit in our trip planner application.
```py
def calculate_exchange_usd(us_dollars, exchange_rate):
  return us_dollars * exchange_rate

new_zealand_exchange = calculate_exchange_usd(100, 1.4)
 
print("100 dollars in US currency would give you " + str(new_zealand_exchange) + " New Zealand dollars")
```

This would output:
```
100 dollars in US currency would give you 140 New Zealand dollars
```

Saving our values returned from a function like we did with new_zealand_exchange allows us to reuse the value (in the form of a variable) throughout the rest of the program.

When there is a result from a function that is stored in a variable, it is called a returned function value.

## Multiple Returns
Sometimes we may want to return more than one value from a function. We can return several values by separating them with a comma. Take a look at this example of a function that allows users in our travel application to check the upcoming week’s weather (starting on Monday):
```PY
weather_data = ['Sunny', 'Sunny', 'Cloudy', 'Raining', 'Snowing']
 
def threeday_weather_report(weather):
  first_day = " Tomorrow the weather will be " + weather[0]
  second_day = " The following day it will be " + weather[1]
  third_day = " Two days from now it will be " + weather[2]
  return first_day, second_day, third_day
```

This function takes in a set of data in the form of a list for the upcoming week’s weather. We can get our returned function values by assigning them to variables when we call the function:
```PY
monday, tuesday, wednesday = threeday_weather_report(weather_data)
 
print(monday)
print(tuesday)
print(wednesday)
```

This will print:
```
Tomorrow the weather will be Sunny
The following day it will be Sunny
Two days from now it will be Cloudy
```
