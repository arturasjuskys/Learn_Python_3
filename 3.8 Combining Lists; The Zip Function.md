# Combining Lists: The Zip Function
## Learn about a popular Python built-in function called zip().

Let’s use a list of student names and associated heights as our example data set:
* Jenny is 61 inches tall
* Alexus is 70 inches tall
* Sam is 67 inches tall
* Grace is 64 inches tall

Suppose that we already had a list of names and a list of heights:
```PY
names = ["Jenny", "Alexus", "Sam", "Grace"]
heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]
```

If we wanted to create a nested list that paired each name with a height, we could use the built-in function zip().

The zip() function takes two (or more) lists as inputs and returns an object that contains a list of pairs. Each pair contains one element from each of the inputs. This is how we would do it for our names and heights lists:
```PY
names_and_heights = zip(names, heights)
```

If we were to then examine this new variable names_and_heights, we would find it looks a bit strange:
```PY
print(names_and_heights)
```

Would output:
```
<zip object at 0x7f1631e86b48>
```

This zip object contains the location of this variable in our computer’s memory. Don’t worry though, it is fairly simple to convert this object into a useable list by using the built-in function list():
```PY
converted_list = list(names_and_heights)
print(converted_list)
```

Outputs:
```
[('Jenny', 61), ('Alexus', 70), ('Sam', 67), ('Grace', 64)]
```

Notice two things:
* Our data set has been converted from a zip memory object to an actual list (denoted by [ ])
* Our inner lists don’t use square brackets [ ] around the values. This is because they have been converted into tuples (an immutable type of list).
