# Learn Python 3: Hello World

## Print
```PY
# from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
print("There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand.")
```

## Variables
```PY
message_string = "Hello there"
# Prints "Hello there"
print(message_string)
```

In the above example, we store the message “Hello there” in a variable called message_string. Variables can’t have spaces or symbols in their names other than an underscore (_). They can’t begin with numbers but they can have numbers after the first letter (e.g., cool_variable_5 is OK).

It’s no coincidence we call these creatures “variables”. If the context of a program changes, we can update a variable but perform the same logical process on it.

## Errors
Two common errors that we encounter while writing Python are SyntaxError and NameError.
* SyntaxError means there is something wrong with the way your program is written — punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a SyntaxError.
* A NameError occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize. Code that contains something that looks like a variable but was never defined will throw a NameError.

## Numbers
Computers can understand much more than just strings of text. Python has a few numeric data types. It has multiple ways of storing numbers. Which one you use depends on your intended purpose for the number you are saving.

An integer, or int, is a whole number. It has no decimal point and contains all counting numbers (1, 2, 3, …) as well as their negative counterparts and the number 0. If you were counting the number of people in a room, the number of jellybeans in a jar, or the number of keys on a keyboard you would likely use an integer.

A floating-point number, or a float, is a decimal number. It can be used to represent fractional quantities as well as precise measurements. If you were measuring the length of your bedroom wall, calculating the average test score of a seventh-grade class, or storing a baseball player’s batting average for the 1998 season you would likely use a float.

Numbers can be assigned to variables or used literally in a program:
```PY
an_int = 2
a_float = 2.1
 
print(an_int + 3)
# Output: 5
```

Above we defined an integer and a float as the variables an_int and a_float. We printed out the sum of the variable an_int with the number 3. We call the number 3 here a literal, meaning it’s actually the number 3 and not a variable with the number 3 assigned to it.

Floating-point numbers can behave in some unexpected ways due to how computers store them. For more information on floating-point numbers and Python, review [Python’s documentation on floating-point limitations](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html).

## Exponents
Python can also perform exponentiation. In written math, you might see an exponent as a superscript number, but typing superscript numbers isn’t always easy on modern keyboards. Since this operation is so related to multiplication, we use the notation **.
```PY
# 2 to the 10th power, or 1024
print(2 ** 10)
 
# 8 squared, or 64
print(8 ** 2)
 
# 9 * 9 * 9, 9 cubed, or 729
print(9 ** 3)
 
# We can even perform fractional exponents
# 4 to the half power, or 2
print(4 ** 0.5)
```

Here, we compute some simple exponents. We calculate 2 to the 10th power, 8 to the 2nd power, 9 to the 3rd power, and 4 to the 0.5th power.

## Modulo
Python offers a companion to the division operator called the [modulo operator](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/modulo?page_ref=catalog). The modulo operator is indicated by % and gives the remainder of a division calculation. If the number is divisible, then the result of the modulo operator will be 0.
```PY
# Prints 4 because 29 / 5 is 5 with a remainder of 4
print(29 % 5)
 
# Prints 2 because 32 / 3 is 10 with a remainder of 2
print(32 % 3)
 
# Modulo by 2 returns 0 for even numbers and 1 for odd numbers
# Prints 0
print(44 % 2)
```

Here, we use the modulo operator to find the remainder of division operations. We see that 29 % 5 equals 4, 32 % 3 equals 2, and 44 % 2 equals 0.

The modulo operator is useful in programming when we want to perform an action every nth-time the code is run. Can the result of a modulo operation be larger than the divisor? Why or why not?

## Concatenation
The + operator doesn’t just add two numbers, it can also “add” two strings! The process of combining two strings is called string concatenation. Performing string concatenation creates a brand new string comprised of the first string’s contents followed by the second string’s contents (without any added space in-between).
```PY 
greeting_text = "Hey there!"
question_text = "How are you doing?"
full_text = greeting_text + question_text

# Prints "Hey there!How are you doing?"
print(full_text)
```

In this sample of code, we create two variables that hold strings and then concatenate them. But we notice that the result was missing a space between the two, let’s add the space in-between using the same concatenation operator!
```PY
full_text = greeting_text + " " + question_text
 
# Prints "Hey there! How are you doing?"
print(full_text)
```

Now the code prints the message we expected.

If you want to concatenate a string with a number you will need to make the number a string first, using the str() function. If you’re trying to print() a numeric variable you can use commas to pass it as a different argument rather than converting it to a string.
```PY
birthday_string = "I am "
age = 10
birthday_string_2 = " years old today!"
 
# Concatenating an integer with strings is possible if we turn the integer into a string first
full_birthday_string = birthday_string + str(age) + birthday_string_2
 
# Prints "I am 10 years old today!"
print(full_birthday_string)
 
# If we just want to print an integer 
# we can pass a variable as an argument to 
# print() regardless of whether 
# it is a string.
 
# This also prints "I am 10 years old today!"
print(birthday_string, age, birthday_string_2)
```

Using str() we can convert variables that are not strings to strings and then concatenate them. But we don’t need to convert a number to a string for it to be an argument to a print statement.

## Plus Equals
Python offers a shorthand for updating variables. When you have a number saved in a variable and want to add to the current value of the variable, you can use the += (plus-equals) operator.
```PY
# First we have a variable with a number saved
number_of_miles_hiked = 12
 
# Then we need to update that variable
# Let's say we hike another two miles today
number_of_miles_hiked += 2
 
# The new value is the old value
# Plus the number after the plus-equals
print(number_of_miles_hiked)
# Prints 14
```

Above, we keep a running count of the number of miles a person has gone hiking over time. Instead of recalculating from the start, we keep a grand total and update it when we’ve gone hiking further.

The plus-equals operator also can be used for string concatenation, like so:
```PY
hike_caption = "What an amazing time to walk through nature!"
 
# Almost forgot the hashtags!
hike_caption += " #nofilter"
hike_caption += " #blessed"
```

We create the social media caption for the photograph of nature we took on our hike, but then update the caption to include important social media tags we almost forgot.

## Multi-line Strings
Python strings are very flexible, but if we try to create a string that occupies multiple lines we find ourselves face-to-face with a SyntaxError. Python offers a solution: multi-line strings. By using three quote-marks (""" or ''') instead of one, we tell the program that the string doesn’t end until the next triple-quote. This method is useful if the string being defined contains a lot of quotation marks and we want to be sure we don’t close it prematurely.
```PY
leaves_of_grass = """
Poets to come! orators, singers, musicians to come!
Not to-day is to justify me and answer what I am for,
But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than
  before known,
Arouse! for you must justify me.
"""
```

In the above example, we assign a famous poet’s words to a variable. Even though the quote contains multiple linebreaks, the code works!

If a multi-line string isn’t assigned a variable or used in an expression it is treated as a comment.
