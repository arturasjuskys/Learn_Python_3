# Strings

## .format()
Python also provides a handy string method for including variables in strings. This method is .format(). .format() takes variables as an argument and includes them in the string that it is run on. You include {} marks as placeholders for where those variables will be imported.

Consider the following function:
```PY
def favorite_song_statement(song, artist):
  return "My favorite song is {} by {}.".format(song, artist)
```

The function favorite_song_statement takes two arguments, song and artist, then returns a string that includes both of the arguments and prints a sentence. Note: .format() can take as many arguments as there are {} in the string it is run on, which in this case is two.

Hereâ€™s an example of the function being run:
```PY
print(favorite_song_statement("Smooth", "Santana"))
# => "My favorite song is Smooth by Santana."
```

Now you may be asking yourself, I could have written this function using string concatenation instead of .format(), why is this method better? The answer is legibility and reusability. It is much easier to picture the end result .format() than it is to picture the end result of string concatenation and legibility is everything. You can also reuse the same base string with different variables, allowing you to cut down on unnecessary, hard to interpret code.
