# Dictionaries

## Introduction to Python Dictionaries
A dictionary is an unordered set of key: value pairs.

It provides us with a way to map pieces of data to each other so that we can quickly find values that are associated with one another.

Suppose we want to store the prices of various items sold at a cafe:
* Avocado Toast is 6 dollars
* Carrot Juice is 5 dollars
* Blueberry Muffin is 2 dollars

In Python, we can create a dictionary called menu to store this data:
```PY
menu = {"avocado toast": 6, "carrot juice": 5, "blueberry muffin": 2}
```

Notice that:
1. A dictionary begins and ends with curly braces { and }.
2. Each item consists of a key ("avocado toast") and a value (6).
3. Each key: value pair is separated by a comma.

It’s considered good practice to insert a space () after each comma, but our code will still run without the space

## Add A Key
To add a single key: value pair to a dictionary, we can use the syntax:
```PY
dictionary[key] = value
```

For example, if we had our menu dictionary from the first exercise:
```PY
menu = {"oatmeal": 3, "avocado toast": 6, "carrot juice": 5, "blueberry muffin": 2}
```

And we wanted to add a new item, "cheesecake" for 8 dollars, we could use:
```PY
menu["cheesecake"] = 8
```

Now, menu looks like:
```PY
{"oatmeal": 3, "avocado toast": 6, "carrot juice": 5, "blueberry muffin": 2, "cheesecake": 8}
```

## Add Multiple Keys
If we wanted to add multiple key : value pairs to a dictionary at once, we can use the .update() method.

Looking at our sensors object from a previous exercise:
```PY
sensors = {"living room": 21, "kitchen": 23, "bedroom": 20}
```

If we wanted to add 3 new rooms, we could use:
```PY
sensors.update({"pantry": 22, "guest room": 25, "patio": 34})
```

This would add all three items to the sensors dictionary.

Now, sensors looks like:
```PY
{"living room": 21, "kitchen": 23, "bedroom": 20, "pantry": 22, "guest room": 25, "patio": 34}
```

## Dict Comprehensions
Let’s say we have two lists that we want to combine into a dictionary, like a list of students and a list of their heights, in inches:
```PY
names = ['Jenny', 'Alexus', 'Sam', 'Grace']
heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]
```
Python allows you to create a dictionary using a dict comprehension, with this syntax:
```PY
students = {key:value for key, value in zip(names, heights)}
#students is now {'Jenny': 61, 'Alexus': 70, 'Sam': 67, 'Grace': 64}
```

Remember that zip() combines two lists into an iterator of tuples with the list elements paired together. This dict comprehension:
1. Takes a pair from the iterator of tuples
2. Names the elements in the pair key (the one originally from the names list) and value (the one originally from the heights list)
3. Creates a key : value item in the students dictionary
4. Repeats steps 1-3 for the entire iterator of pairs
